                    <p class="item"> Laugenbrezel "Louise"</p>
                    <p><strong>Louise</strong> traditionally consists of wheat flour, malt, salt, baker's yeast, fat (margarine, butter) and water. Louise takes a bath in caustic soda. Variants are available made from wholemeal, spelt or mixed flours.</p>

                    <p class="item"> Baguette "Brigitte"</p>
                    <p><strong>Brigitte</strong> is an elongated crusty white bread of French origin. The porosity of the crumb is always very coarse and uneven, the proportion of crust in relation to the crumb is high and is responsible for the strong aromatic flavor. </p>

                    <p class="item"> Panini "Peter"</p>
                    <p><strong>Peter</strong> is Italian-influenced pastry. A small bread (ital. pane), and comparable with the German rolls. At "Die Brezel", he comes in different shapes and sizes, and the dough is often artfully braided or looped in other shapes. </p>

                    <p class="item"> Roggenbrot "Richard"</p>
                    <p><strong>Richard</strong> is a real heavy-weight. Flowerwise and with respect to its size. At lbs 2.5 he feeds an entire family with tasty rye, baked to perfection in our farm-style firewood oven. "Richard" is also available in larger portions.</p>

        <em>Erhard's bread is a very good bread. I used to eat five slices of bread from our local baker. When I discovered "Die Brezel" and especially Erhard's sourdough bread this changed my diet completely. Know I eat only one slice per meal. One slice of Erhard's bread is enough.</em>
